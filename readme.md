## Answers

### Squares is not phpMyAdmin

With phpMyAdmin you can create tables and run SQL queries. The downside is that phpMyAdmin does not have a great user experience, in my opinion.

Squares is more focused around editing the data with already created tables. It's really easy to step between different cells and edit the data without hassle. Squares also provide more field types, like checkboxes and markdown.

### Squares is not a CMS

Different field types can be seen in html5, in forms but also in CMS. Squares have different field types as well. It's still not a form or a CMS.

- In a CMS you are editing pages. In Squares, you edit tables and table cells.
- In a CMS you have functions and classes to create a site. Squares can not be used to build a site. It has no functions and no classes for site building.

If you have a complex project, where you need to edit the database tables directly, use Squares. If you need to build a site, use a CMS. [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/) is an excellent choice for that.

## Squares is not Airtable or a spreadsheet

I'm heavily inspired by these services. However, they can never compete because they are not made for editing self hosted database tables. They are made for editing data and store it in the cloud.
